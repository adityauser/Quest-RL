# Distributional-RL
I have implemented <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06887.pdf">Categorical Distributional DQN</a> on OpenAI gym cartpole environment<br>
For the sake of simplicity(implementation), I have taken gamma to be 1 and to avoid complex network I have taken num_atoms to be 21 in place of 51.
