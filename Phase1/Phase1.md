# Phase 1

In the 1st phase, I tried to manipulate the reward function, and I have the basic idea of Duel-DQN and Prioritize-replay, so I tried to implement both of them and messed the code which leads to some compelling observations.
I have also uploaded a <a href="https://github.com/adityauser/Quest-RL/edit/master/Phase1">model</a> of each agent, the name of the model is in the format GxEDytrailz.h5, here :
* x = value of gamma
* y = value of epsilon_decay
* z = trail number (3 trails for each setting of hyperparameters)
