# Quest-RL
Analyzing result obtained with quite different Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

## The Quest
With just few changes in hyperparameters the convergence of Q-newtoks dramatically changes, in this quest we will analyze this on different algorithm.
The experiment shows how strange Deep Reinforcement Learning is

## Elements
I have used Q-Learing with Prioritized Replay and Duel Q Networks(DDQN)
Agent will run on different hyperparameter setting for gamma and epsilon
For each hyperparameter setting I have ran experiment 3 times
I will be using OpenAI gym CartPole-v1 environment

## Overview 
Experiment is done over three different models (Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3)
Experiment is done over 9 epsilon_decay setting and 5 gamma setting i.e. 9x5 settings
Each setting is tested 3 times

Running each phase took 13hours on my i5 7th Gen laptop

Go through each Phase
